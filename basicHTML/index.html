        <h3>What Mary Oliver's critics don't understand</h3>
        <h2>For America's most beloved poet, paying attention to nature in a springboard to the sacred.</h2>

            <p>Oliver uses nature as a springboard to the sacred - the beating heart of her work.</p>

        <p>"Mary Oliver is saving my life," Paul Chowder, the title character of Nicholson Baker's novel "<a href="https://vnexpress.net">The anthrologist</a>," scrawls in the margins of Oliver's "<a href="https://vnexpress.net">New and Selected Poems, Volume One</a>." A struggling poet, Chowder is suffering from a severe case of writer's block. His girlfriend, with whom he's lived for eight years, has just left him, ostensibly because he has been unable to write the long-overdue introduction to a poetry anthology that he has been putting together. For solace and inspiration, he turns to poets who have been his touchstones - Louise Bogan, Theodore Roethke, Sara Teasdale - before discovering Oliver. In her work, he finds consolation: "I immediately felt more sure of what I was doing." Of her poems, he says, "They're very simple. And yet each has something."</p>

            <div>I don't know what a prayer is.</div>
            <div>I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down</div>
            <div>into the grass, how to kneel down in the grass,</div>
            <div>how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,</div>
            <div>which is what I have been doing all day.</div>
        </ul>
        <p>The cadences are almost Biblical. "Attention is the beginning of devotion," she urges elsewhere.</p>
